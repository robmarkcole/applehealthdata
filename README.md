This package is based on the ICD-10-based formulations of the Charlson score and Elixhauser score proposed by Quan _et al_. in 2005. The ICD-9 formulation of the Charlson score is also from Quan _et al_. The ICD-9-based Elixhauser score is according to the AHRQ formulation (Moore _et al_., 2017). Weights for the Charlson score are based on the original formulation by Charlson _et al_. in 1987, while weights for the Elixhauser score are based on work by van Walraven _et al_. Finally, the categorisation of scores and weighted scores is based on work by Menendez _et al_.
